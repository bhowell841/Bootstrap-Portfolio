        <p>My name is Brendan Howell.  I began to learn coding on my own several year ago.  After playing around with HTML and CSS I decided to take a class.  I enrolled at Durham Technical Community College.  Two and a half years later I had earned myself a Certificate in Jave Programming. A year later I was offerred a 6 month internship at the Office of Information Technology at Duke University , while concurrently taking a Python programming course at Durham tech.  During this time I became convinced that I wanted to become a programmer.</p>
        <p>I completed my intership with Duke in December of 2017, and began a short intership with Global Analytic Services in June 2018.  Both internships taught me many things about working in the this field, but none more than I didn't have the skills necessary to work as a programmer.  I enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp soon after finishing my internship with Global Analytic Services.</p>
        <p>I began the Bootcamp in November 2018 and have learned the hard work and dedication that it takes to be successful as a programmer.  I have entreched myself in yet another coding language, and have developed skills to work on the front end and back end of websites.  I look forward to finishing my studies at the bootcamp and embarking on a new career.</p>
